Dealing with missing data
Construct a database with 100,000 rows where each record has 100 fields. 
Assume further that for each record, each of the 100 fields has a one percent chance of being empty, 
i.e., its value is missing. If we were to remove all records with two or more empty fields, 
what percentage of records would we remove?
